# Tic Tac Toe Brain Storming:

- Two players will start the game
- Player 1 will always be X.
- Player 2 will always be O.
- Draw the board & mark it with X and O according to the player clicking on the cell inside the board.
- Decide wither there will be a winner or a tie.
- Check for winning pattern and if yes it means there is a winner:
Stop the game by not allowing for further clicks

- If there is a tie game over and reset the board.
- The player can only click once in the cell and they wont be allowed to change the place of the marked cell until the other player turn finish.
- Xs & Os should be switching for every click
- The players will have two options Start or Reset.
